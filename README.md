## UFOs

# Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to build a dynamic and functional webpage that not only accepts user inputs, but adjusts accordingly to display various information about UFO sightings.
The filter tabs setup will allow the user to sort the data based on event date, city, state, country, and shape of sightings.

### This is how the blank filters page appears when first navigating to the page.

### How the filters are used:

The user can sort by just one, or all of the various filters in the search fields. After selecting an input box, typing in an input for said field will instanly display the data with that key value in it. For example, if a user enters the date of 1/1/2010, and the city to "san diego" they are given the two results that match those criteria

## Summary
With this specific search design I can see a few drawbacks. The main one being that the user would be required to know the exact parameters they wanted to search for in order to find the corresponding data. Some of the shapers for instance, are listed as "light" which isn't a normal definition of a shape. So that could be confusing to the user when trying to locate the information.

### Suggestions 
As the filter is setup currently, I do see a few easy changes that could streamline the process for the user. 
1. With each category available to filter, adding a simple drop down menu with the lists showing values able to be filtered would greatly improve the ease of locating data.
2. Instead of having to scroll to the top of the webpage and hitting the UFO sightings button to reset the data, adding a "Clear" button under the input boxes would let the user easily clear anything selected and start the search anew.
